## 2.6.0

This is a minor feature release.

Feature:
* Add a function to atomically write files

## 2.5.2

This is a minor maintenance release.

Maintenance:
* Fix adding URLs to classpath under Java 9.

## 2.5.1

This is a minor maintenance release.

## 2.5.0

This is a minor feature release.

Features:
* add a `stream->sha256` function for hashing the contents of an InputStream

## 2.4.0

This is a minor feature and improvement release.

Features:
* add a `utf8-string->sha256` function, directly analogous to `utf8-string->sha1`
* add a `file->sha256` function, equivalent to reading a file's contents as a
  UTF-8 string and hashing the result. Uses an InputStream internally to avoid
  reading the entire file into memory at once.

Improvement:
* the `open-port-num` function should now return a random port number from the
  entire traditional ephemeral port range of 49152 through 65535.

## 2.3.0

This is a minor feature release.

Features:
* add a parser for period strings (7d, 12h, etc) into Joda Periods

## 2.2.0

This is a minor feature release.

Features:

* Add an `assoc-if-new` macro, which associates a map key to a value only if
  the key does not already exist in the map.
* Add a `deref-swap!` function, which behaves like deref but returns the old
  value instead of the new one.
* Add a `rand-str` function, for generating random strings from various
  character sets.

Maintenance:

* Update to dynapath 0.2.5, to address some compatibility issues with Java 9.

## 2.1.1

The 2.1.1 release was burned and folded into 2.2.0.

## 2.1.0

This is a minor feature release.

  that bind services to ports can use this to guard against chance port
  collisions.

## 2.0.0

This is a bugfix release which contains one backward incompatible change.

  of `raynes.fs` to reduce downstream dependency conflicts.
* Add an `absolute-path` fn to replace the one that was removed from raynes.fs
* Add a `normalized-path` fn to replace the one that was removed from raynes.fs

## 1.2.0

* Add `temp-file-name` function, which returns a unique name to a temporary file, 
  but does not actually create the file.
* Add `with-timeout` macro, which returns a default value if executing an 
  arbitrary block of code takes longer than a specified timeout.

## 1.1.0

* Add new `walk-leaves` function for applying a function to all of the leaf
  nodes of a map
* Add new `zipper?` predicate which can be used to assert that an object
  is a clojure zipper.
* Add new `while-let` macro
* Add new `rand-weighted-selection` function
* Add new `to-sentence` variant of string join

## 1.0.0
* Promoting previous release to 1.0.0 so that we can be more deliberate about
  adhering to semver from now on.

## 0.7.3
* Add 'filter-map' function that can be used to filter maps

## 0.7.2

* Add mkdirs! function to create parent directories with better failure reporting
* Move temp file functions from testutils to core

## 0.6.0

* Upgrade cheshire dependency to version 5.3.1.

## 0.5.3
* .ini parsing utilities now throw an Exception if a key appears in the file(s) more than once.
* Added a `with-no-jvm-shutdown-hooks` macro for running a block of code without any JVM shutdown hooks.

## 0.5.2
 * Minor change to the cli! function so that, in addition to the data that it already returned, it now also returns a string representation of a banner/usage summary.  Callers can use this to display a help message if additional validation of the cli args fails.
 * Utility functions added to ssl namespace that allow creation of an SSLContext or a KeyStore/TrustStore directly from the pem files. 
 * Added some JSON utility functions
 * Added a deep-merge utility function
